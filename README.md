# ⚙️ H2GP Manager

**H2GP Manager** is a race management tool designed to monitor **driver changes**, **battery tracking**, and **hydrostick rotation** during a Hydrogen Horizon Grand Prix (H2GP) endurance race.

This project was created in my spare time to help streamline for my team coordination and improve performance during the 6-hour events.

📌 This program runs **fully locally** or through [my website](https://miphonya.ch/H2GPManager/), with no external server dependencies or cloud storage.
